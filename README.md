# Three.js-Learning-Curve-

Getting to grips with the 3D library that is three.js and improving my coding skills.
The lessons learned here will contribute to completing my masters thesis project - creating
a web-based tool that models the HAMR objects as a set of finite elements and calculates 
the deformation and subsequent changes in forces due to the change in the shape of debris. 
This tool was created using JavaScript + WebGL in order for it to be easily shared.
